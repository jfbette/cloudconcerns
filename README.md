# CloudConcerns: Understanding Intrusion and data leakage in the Cloud.

CloudConcerns is an open-source project aimed at documenting, analyzing, and mitigating *intrusion* and *data leakage* scenarios in cloud environments, with a special focus on AWS (Amazon Web Services). 

This project cloud serves as a resource for cloud security professionals, developers, and IT administrators or just curious to understand the inherent risks associated with public cloud environments and implement effective security measures.

## About the Project

Public cloud environments, while offering scalability and efficiency, also introduce unique security challenges. Data leakage in the cloud can occur due to various reasons, ranging from misconfigured services to sophisticated cyber attacks. This project compiles various scenarios of data leakage, provides some tools for exploitation, and offers methodologies and remediation strategies to mitigate these risks.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Scenarios List**: A detailed directory of data leakage scenarios in AWS.
- **Exploitation Tooling**: Tools and scripts to simulate or demonstrate data leakage and intrusion
- **Methodology and Remediation**: Best practices and strategies to secure AWS environments against data leaks.
- **Risk Explanation**: In-depth analysis of the inherent risks associated with using public clouds.

### Structure of the project.
- `scenarios` : list of all scenarios listed by catergories
- `scenarios/intrusion`: list all scenarios representing intrusion risk on your IS
- `scenarios/dataleakage`: list all scenarios representing data-leakage risks from your IS

## WIP 

This project is a **work in progress**. Scenarios, tools, and documentation will be regularly updated and added as the project evolves. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute to the ongoing development. Contribution on Azure is far from welcome
